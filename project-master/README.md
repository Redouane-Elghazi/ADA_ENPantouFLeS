# Cooking for dummies

# Abstract
Eating is one of the core actions we do everyday. But cooking does not seem to be as core as eating, as precooked food seem to be more popular than ever. Moreover, with the restructuring of the society in terms of gender, cooking lessons are now meant for specialists that intend to work as cooks. Because of that, people don't necessarily know how to cook anymore.
Still, eating healthy and at a moderate price requires some cooking. And cooking requires some understanding of foodstuffs and their synergies.
To give some clue about these synergies is the goal of our project, by studying a various set of recipes.

# Research questions
How important are synergies between foodstuffs?
What links can we find between calories and foodstuffs?
Are there some balances that are hard to do in terms of calories? (e.g. very low fat with very high protein)
